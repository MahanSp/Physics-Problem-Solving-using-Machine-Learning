# Mechanics Problems for Machine Learning in Physics

This directory is dedicated to the application of machine learning techniques to solve classical mechanics problems in physics. It serves as an intersection of physics and AI, showcasing how machine learning can provide insights into physical systems. The initial focus is on two fundamental problems:

## Directory Structure

- `01-Projectile-Motion/`
  - **Problem**: Analyzing the motion of a projectile.
  - **Objective**: To predict the trajectory of a projectile under the influence of gravity using machine learning models.
  - **Approach**: Training regression models on simulated data to learn the underlying physics of projectile motion.

- `02-Non-Linear-Pendulum/`
  - **Problem**: Studying the motion of a non-linear pendulum.
  - **Objective**: To understand the complex dynamics of a non-linear pendulum, which can exhibit chaotic behavior under certain conditions.
  - **Approach**: Utilizing machine learning to identify patterns and predict future states of the pendulum system.

## Purpose

The purpose of these exercises is to demonstrate the potential of machine learning in uncovering the dynamics and predicting the behavior of mechanical systems in physics. Each directory contains:

- A detailed `README.md` explaining the problem context, the dataset, and the machine learning approach used.
- Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step solutions, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- Data files and simulation scripts used to generate the training data.
