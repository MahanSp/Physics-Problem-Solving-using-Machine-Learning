# Non-Linear Pendulum Problem Analysis

## Introduction
This report covers the analysis and solution of the non-linear pendulum problem, a classic problem in physics, using machine learning techniques. The goal was to predict the motion of a non-linear pendulum, which is a complex and dynamically rich system.

## Methodology

### Data Generation
- Data for the non-linear pendulum's motion was simulated, considering factors like angle, angular velocity, and time.
- The simulation captures the pendulum's behavior over time, providing a dataset for training the machine learning model.

### Data Preprocessing
- The dataset was processed to ensure quality and to structure it suitably for machine learning algorithms.

### Training and Evaluation
- The Basic Neural Network, Deep Neural Network, Recurrent Neural Network and Gradient Boosting models were trained using the simulated pendulum data.
- The models were evaluated on their ability to accurately predict the motion of the non-linear pendulum.

## Conclusion
The application of machine learning to predict the motion of a non-linear pendulum showcased the potential of AI in understanding and forecasting complex physical systems. Further research and more sophisticated models could enhance the accuracy and reliability of such predictions.
