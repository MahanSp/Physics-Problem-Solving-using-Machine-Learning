# Physics Undergraduate Project: Physics Problem Solving using Machine Learning.

## Overview
This repository is a comprehensive collection of my work during my undergraduate project in physics, where I've applied machine learning techniques to solve various problems in the field. My journey began with learning machine learning through the [Maktabkhooneh](https://maktabkhooneh.org) website, and this repository not only showcases my exercises from the course but also extends to applying these newly acquired skills to practical problems in physics.

## Repository Structure

### `Exercises/`
- Contains all the exercises I completed as part of the machine learning course on Maktabkhooneh. This directory serves as the foundation of my journey in machine learning.

### Mechanics Problems
- Early applications of machine learning in physics started with solving fundamental mechanics problems.
- Utilized basic machine learning models to understand and predict various mechanical systems.
- Tackled the complex problem of a non-linear pendulum.
- This challenge required a deeper dive into machine learning, leading me to explore and implement neural network models.
- The pendulum problem demonstrates the use of advanced AI techniques in understanding chaotic systems in physics.

### Perovskite Materials Project
- The culmination of my learning experience was applied to a project on perovskite materials.
- This project involved using all the knowledge and techniques I learned in machine learning to predict and analyze the properties of perovskite materials.
- It showcases the integration of machine learning into materials science.

## Conclusion
This repository reflects my growth and learning trajectory in applying machine learning to physics. From basic exercises to complex real-world applications.
